1. Upon starting the game you will have an option of choosing how many players are playing the game and how many days 
	the game will last for. In each "day" you will be able to do up to two actions to each and every pet.
	
2. You will be asked for the name of each player and the name(s) and species of their pet(s). Names must contain only characters 
	and be unique from all other names.

3. Each player is now able to view the stats of their pet as well as perform actions.

4. The store may be visited to check a players inventory as well as buy food and toys for their pets.

5. At the end of each day the stats of each players pets will be stored to calculate their end score.

6. If any of the pets stats reach zero the pet will die. Each pet may be revived once before staying dead for the remainder of
	the game.
	



ACTIONS
Play: Let a pet play with toys you have bought from the store. This decreases its energy and increases the pets mood,
	 more so if its the pets favorite
	toy. If the toy is not the pets favorite it will be rougher with the toy, causing it to break sooner.
Feed: select food items you have bought from the store to give to your pet. This action helps restore the 'Hunger' bar of the
	pet.
Toilet: Relieves the pet and restores the 'Toilet' bar.
Sleep: Restores the pets 'Energy' bar. This does not advance a day forward in the game.



RANDOM EVENTS - After each day there is a chance any pet will get a random event.
Misbehaving: If your pet begins to misbehave you have the option of correcting the behaviour with a punishment, the pet will
	feel unhappy after this.
Sick: If the pet becomes sick, you have the option to cure the pet for $10 and it will feel happier after this, if not the
	pet will stay sick.
